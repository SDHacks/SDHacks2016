              h3 What is a hackathon?
              p A hackathon is an event, typically lasting
                | multiple days, in which a large number of
                | people meet to collaboratively build out their
                | ideas using technology. We'll be partaking in
                a(href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_culture") this
                |  kind of hacking, not
                a(href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkDD03yeLnU") this
                |  kind.
            .qa
              h3 Who can attend?
              p Any college or high school students over 18 years of age from anywhere in the world are eligible. This includes graduate students, but be sure to understand any agreements you’ve made with your university with regards to research and IP. If you are enrolled at a UC campus but not yet 18, you are also eligible to participate. We wish we could invite minors but unfortunately cannot for legal reasons.
            .qa
              h3 What should I bring?
              p Bring your student ID, computer, any external peripherals you may need (chargers, monitors, etc.), any other hardware that you definitely plan on using, and an open mind. Also bring a change of clothes, a toothbrush, and any other toiletries you may need. You may also bring a sleeping bag if you plan to nap.
            .qa
              h3 When should I show up and when should I leave?
              p You should plan to arrive at the hackathon late Friday evening and to leave early Sunday afternoon. A detailed schedule will be released closer to the event date.

            .qa
              h3 What if I don't have a team?
              p We allow teams of up to four hackers. If you’re concerned that you may not have a team going in, no worries! We will host a team formation event at the beginning of the hackathon so that no one has to hack alone (unless they want to). If you do have a team, we will do our best to accept you all. Make sure ALL members apply and include all other members’ addresses in their applications.
            .qa
              h3 How do I get there?
              p We will send buses to most-- if not all-- undergraduate UC campuses. Unfortunately, we will not be able to provide any reimbursements to those traveling from outside of California.
            .qa
              h3 Do I have to pay to get in?
              p Nope!
            .qa
              h3 How can I help?
              p Please email us at
                a(href="mailto:hello@sdhacks.io") hello@sdhacks.io
                |  if you have a question not listed here or if
                | you’re interested in helping out!
            .qa
              h3 Are there any rules?
              p
                | As a Major League Hacking member event, we are
                | adopting Major League Hacking’s
                a(href="http://static.mlh.io/docs/mlh-code-of-conduct.pdf") Code of Conduct
                |  which requires you to respect others and help
                | us keep SD Hacks a safe space for everyone. If
                | you want your project to be considered for an
                | award, you may only submit work that your team
                | wrote during the hackathon.
